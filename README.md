# City Event Connect

City Event Connect is a community-driven event discovery platform
designed to connect multiple colleges within a city through a
centralized event management system.

This project addresses the communication gap between institutions by
providing a structured platform where students can explore and register
for academic, technical, and cultural events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚩 Problem Statement

In many cities, colleges conduct workshops, hackathons, tech fests, and
cultural programs independently.

However:

-   Students from other colleges are often unaware of these events.
-   Event information is scattered across social media and messaging
    groups.
-   There is no centralized academic event ecosystem.

This leads to missed opportunities and reduced participation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Solution

City Event Connect provides:

-   A centralized event discovery platform
-   Multi-college event visibility
-   Structured filtering and search
-   Dynamic event registration system
-   Registration fee handling

The system enables students to discover, filter, and register for events
across institutions efficiently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✨ Key Features

-   Add Event (Organizer Interface)
-   Search by Event Title
-   Filter by College
-   Filter by Category (Tech / Cultural / Sports)
-   Upcoming Events Filter
-   Dynamic Registration Fee
-   Registration Modal
-   Local Data Persistence using LocalStorage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: - HTML - CSS - JavaScript

Data Handling: - Browser LocalStorage (Prototype Persistence)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚙ How It Works

1.  Organizer adds event details.
2.  Event is dynamically rendered on the homepage.
3.  Students search and filter events.
4.  Students register through modal form.
5.  Registration state is stored locally.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

-   Backend Integration (Node.js / Firebase)
-   Authentication System for Organizers
-   Payment Gateway Integration (Razorpay / Stripe)
-   Admin Approval Workflow
-   Analytics Dashboard
-   Email & SMS Notifications
-   Cloud Deployment

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Impact

-   Encourages inter-college collaboration
-   Improves event visibility
-   Builds a city-level academic ecosystem
-   Scalable to district/state level

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Project Status

Frontend prototype built for hackathon demonstration. Designed with
scalability in mind for production-level deployment.

## 📄 Additional Note

This project demonstrates dynamic UI rendering, state management,
conditional filtering, and modular frontend architecture within a
time-constrained hackathon environment.
